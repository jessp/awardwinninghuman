            <p>Maria is an anime-inspired holographic virtual assistant you can make at home. She runs on Raspberry Pi.</p>
            <p>I 3D modelled the character and the case, developed the interactions using C and Python, and developed the website.</p>
            <p>Maria was featured on <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-anime-holographic-assistant" target="_blank">Tom's Hardware</a> and <a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/11/22/anime-inspired-holographic-virtual-assistant/" target="_blank">Hackaday</a>.</p>

            <p>For Goodwill Hunting, I wanted to know what types of clothes are donated to Goodwill charity shops across the USA, and make some beautiful charts about my findings.</p>
            <p>I scraped years worth of data from the Goodwill website, and used D3 to visualize it.</p>
            <p>This project made #1 on Hacker News. It's my nerdiest claim to fame.</p>

            <p>Explore the covers of more than a decade of New York Times best-sellers (approximately 5,000 books!) and judge your heart out.</p>
            <p>I created this project for The Pudding, using data from The New York Times. The grid of books uses Mario Klingemannâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/Quasimondo/RasterFairy" target="_blank">RasterFairy</a> library to arrange, and <a href="https://openseadragon.github.io/" target="_blank">OpenSeadragon</a> to display.</p>
            <p>You can also filter by metadata from Goodreads and The New York Times, and by visual features detected by the Google Cloud Vision API.</p>

            <p>For my Master's Thesis, I developed open-source code written in JavaScript that can be used to replicate many different knitting techniques on whole-garment knitting machines.</p>
            <p>This built off of work by the Carnegie Mellon Textiles Lab.</p>
