	<h1>I'm Jess Peter and I'm in between websites right now.</h1>
	<h2>
		You can either go back in time and look at <a target="_blank" href="../old.html">my old portfolio</a>, or you can just check out some of the highlights below.
	</h2>
	<p>
		In <span style="font-weight: bold">2019</span>, I completed an MDes at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design.
		I did a <a target="_blank" href="https://jessp.github.io/kcodeblog/">neat-o thesis</a> on whole-garment knitting. I also did some cool freelance work, like <a target="_blank" href="https://jessp.github.io/book_covers/">this piece</a> for The Pudding which will be coming out later this year.
	</p>
	<p>
		From <span style="font-weight: bold">2016 to 2017</span>, I worked as the lead front-end developer and designer on The Globe and Mail's internal analytics tool, Sophi. It was pretty hush-hush during my time there, but they published a <a target="_blank" href="https://globelink.ca/revealed/#MeetSophi">promotional video</a> shortly after I left, and you can read <a target="_blank" href="http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/1867/1/Szigeti_Sophi_2017.pdf">a paper</a> about some of my early work on the Sophi heads-up display.
	</p>
	<p>
		I graduated from OCAD University in <span style="font-weight: bold">2015</span>. While there, I co-authored <a target="_blank" href="./../assets/JPeter_pubs2017.pdf">a bunch of papers</a> as part of some of their research labs. I still have a soft spot for the website I did for my <a target="_blank" href="http://thesis.awardwinninghuman.com/">Bachelor's thesis</a>.

	<p>In case I missed something, you can <a target="_blank" href="./../assets/JP_resume_2019.pdf">download my CV</a>, or contact me at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:jess@awardwinninghuman.com">jess@awardwinninghuman.com</a>.</p>
