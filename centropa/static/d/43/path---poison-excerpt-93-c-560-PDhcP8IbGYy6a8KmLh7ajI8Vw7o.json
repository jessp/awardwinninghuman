figuratively older</p>\n<p>Wiser</p>\n<p>Wise</p>\n<p>Wiser</p>\n<p>SHE: Wiser?</p>\n<p>HE: Yes</p>\n<p>SHE: (<em>laughs</em>) If only</p>\n<p>HE: I’m glad to see you</p>\n<p>On the way here I kept thinking:</p>\n<p>How will she look?</p>\n<p>How will she look now?</p>\n<p>And I couldn’t stop thinking about the first time I ever saw you</p>\n<p>SHE: That’s twenty years ago</p>\n<p>HE: I couldn’t

strange?</p>\n<p>That things only happen when it doesn’t matter anymore</p>\n<p>When you don’t really need it any more</p>\n<p>HE: Are you talking about me?</p>\n<p>SHE: Partly</p>\n<p>HE: So it doesn’t really matter to you that I’m here</p>\n<p>SHE: I’m not saying that</p>\n<p>HE: You are saying that</p>\n<p>SHE: But I don’t mean it</p>\n<p>HE: You don’t need me any more</p>\n<p>SHE: No</p>\n<p>That’s positive isn’t it?</p>\n<p>If you don’t need something any more</p>\n<p>If you can do without it?</p>\n<p>Not be dependent?</p>\n<p>I mean it in a positive way</p>\n<p>HE: So are you glad or not that I’m here?</p>\n<p>SHE: I’m very glad you’re here</p>\n<p>That we’re here now</p>\n<p>Together</p>\n<p>Washed ashore</p>\n<p>So to speak</p>\n<p>HE: Do you feel washed ashore?</p>\n<p>SHE: Yeah well, no</p>\n<p>In some way or other…yes</p>\n<p>HE: In what way then?</p>\n<p>SHE: Just</p>\n<p>Yeah</p>\n<p>Forget I said it</p>\n<p>It’s more metaphorical</p>\n<p><em>SHE gets up.</em></p>\n<p>HE: Where are you going</p>\n<p>SHE: I’m going to go and see if I can find someone</p>\n<p>I mean</p>\n<p>It’s nearly quarter past two</p>\n<p>HE: I just heard a door</p>\n<p>SHE: Where?</p>\n<p>HE: Back there somewhere</p>\n<p><em>SHE walks to the door that HE points out.</em></p>\n<p>HE: It’s locked</p>\n<p><em>SHE tries the door, knocks.</em></p>\n<p>SHE: Hallo?</p>\n<p>Is anyone there?</p>\n<p>Mr. Alewijnse?</p>\n<p>HE: Are you sure it was here?</p>\n<p>SHE: That’s what it said in the letter</p>\n<p><em>HE takes the letter and checks it through.</em></p>\n<p>HE: Zuiderplantsoen 24-28</p>\n<p>SHE: That’s here</p>\n<p><em>Long silence.</em></p>\n<p>SHE:<em> </em>31st of December 1999</p>\n<p>It’s a long time ago, eh?</p>\n<p>HE: Yes</p>\n<p>SHE: 31st of December 1999</p>\n<p>HE: I know</p>\n<p>SHE: At ten past seven</p>\n<p>HE: You still know what time it was?</p>\n<p>SHE: The door closed</p>\n<p>I looked at the clock</p>\n<p>Ten past seven</p>\n<p>I can’t help it</p>\n<p>I’ll just never forget it</p>\n<p>HE: I’m sorry</p>\n<p>SHE: What did you actually do that evening?</p>\n<p>HE: I went to Plombières</p>\n<p>SHE: To your mother’s house?</p>\n<p>HE: Yes</p>\n<p>A bit before midnight I stopped in a car park just outside Nancy</p>\n<p>I was the only car there</p>\n<p>And I watched the sky above Nancy light up</p>\n<p>There was only light</p>\n<p>No sound</p>\n<p>I thought that was so strange</p>\n<p>That I didn’t hear anything</p>\n<p>That Nancy had entered a new millenium, silently, as far as I could hear</p>\n<p>I felt</p>\n<p>Yeah well actually, all sorts of things</p>\n<p>I wanted to phone you, but then I thought: “Idiot, you just up and leave on a day like today and then go to phone her at midnight”</p>\n<p>So I didn’t phone</p>\n<p>SHE: I know</p>\n<p>HE: It’s funny actually</p>\n<p>Well, funny…</p>\n<p>I can’t help noticing</p>\n<p>More and more</p>\n<p>How often you do things without really wanting to</p>\n<p>SHE: Are you talking about that evening?</p>\n<p>HE: No yeah, well yeah</p>\n<p>I mean in general</p>\n<p>For myself</p>\n<p>That it’s funny</p>\n<p>How often I do things without really wanting to</p>\n<p>And don’t do what I actually want to do</p>\n<p>That evening too, I think, yeah</p>\n<p>SHE: You don’t need to apologise</p>\n<p>HE: I’m not</p>\n<p>It’s more of an insight that comes after the event</p>\n<p>We probably all reach the same place in the end</p>\n<p>SHE: Is that so?</p>\n<p>HE: The same conclusion I mean</p>\n<p>SHE: And what is that conclusion then?</p>\n<p>According to you?</p>\n<p>HE: That we do what we’d rather not</p>\n<p>And don’t do what we’d rather do</p>\n<p><em>SHE laughs.</em></p>\n<p>That makes you laugh?</p>\n<p>SHE: Yes, to hear you say that</p>\n<p>I think it’s funny</p>\n<p>HE: Oh</p>\n<p>SHE: It is funny isn’t it?</p>\n<p>HE: If you say so</p>\n<p>SHE: Are you getting touchy?</p>\n<p>You’re not going to start getting all touchy are you?</p>\n<p>HE: No</p>\n<p>SHE: But?</p>\n<p>HE: But nothing</p>\n<p>Just…</p>\n<p><em>Short silence.</em></p>\n<p>SHE: Don’t you think it’s bizarre seeing each other here after all these years?</p>\n<p><em>HE says nothing.</em></p>\n<p>I do</p>\n<p>I think it’s bizarre</p>\n<p>Bizarre how things turn out</p>\n<p>HE: You could see it like that, yes</p>\n<p>SHE: What would you call it then?</p>\n<p>HE: I haven’t given it that much thought</p>\n<p>SHE: You haven’t given it that much thought?</p>\n<p>HE: No, I haven’t given it that much thought, no</p>\n<p>SHE: You see me for the first time in ten years</p>\n<p>HE: Nine years</p>\n<p>SHE: In this place</p>\n<p>And you haven’t given it that much thought</p>\n<p>HE: No</p>\n<p>SHE: Unbelievable</p>\n<p>Is there anything you have given much thought?</p>\n<p>Like what we’re going to do if it is all true</p>\n<p>If it turns out that those two hundred graves do need to be moved</p>\n<p>What we’re going to do then?</p>\n<p>Where he’s supposed to go?</p>\n<p>HE: I want to hear what they’ve got to say first</p>\n<p>What the options are</p>\n<p>And the costs of course</p>\n<p>SHE: The costs?</p>\n<p>HE: There are bound to be costs</p>\n<p>SHE: We’re talking about Jacob’s reinterment and you’re talking about the costs!</p>\n<p>HE: I’m sorry</p>\n<p>I didn’t mean it like that</p>\n<p>Not how you just said it</p>\n<p>SHE: How then?</p>\n<p>HE:  I just meant it in general</p>\n<p>Please don’t do this</p>\n<p>You know I didn’t mean it like that</p>\n<p>It’s ridiculous to act as if I meant it like that</p>\n<p><em>SHE goes to say something, thinks better of it, long silence.</em></p>\n<p>SHE: I’m starving</p>\n<p>HE: I’ve got a bit of chocolate somewhere</p>\n<p><em>HE fumbles about in his jacket pockets, pulls out a bit of chocolate and give it to her.</em></p>\n<p>HE: You used to be addicted</p>\n<p>SHE: Yeah</p>\n<p>HE: Are you still?</p>\n<p>SHE: Trying to cut down</p>\n<p>Do you want some?</p>\n<p>HE: I’ve already had three bars</p>\n<p><em>Silence.
