here</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> I’m not saying that</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> You are saying that</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> But I don’t mean it</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> You don’t need me any more</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> No</p>\n<p>That’s positive isn’t it?</p>\n<p>If you don’t need something any more</p>\n<p>If you can do without it?</p>\n<p>Not be dependent?</p>\n<p>I mean it

then?</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> Just</p>\n<p>Yeah</p>\n<p>Forget I said it</p>\n<p>It’s more metaphorical</p>\n<p><em>SHE gets up.</em></p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> Where are you going</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> I’m going to go and see if I can find someone</p>\n<p>I mean</p>\n<p>It’s nearly quarter past two</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> I just heard a door</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> Where?</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> Back there somewhere</p>\n<p><em>SHE walks to the door that HE points out.</em></p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> It’s

seven</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> You still know what time it was?</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> The door closed</p>\n<p>I looked at the clock</p>\n<p>Ten past seven</p>\n<p>I can’t help it</p>\n<p>I’ll just never forget it</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> I’m sorry</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> What did you actually do that evening?</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> I went to Plombières</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> To your mother’s house?</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> Yes</p>\n<p>A bit before midnight I stopped in a car park just outside Nancy</p>\n<p>I was the only car there</p>\n<p>And I watched the sky above Nancy light up</p>\n<p>There was only light</p>\n<p>No sound</p>\n<p>I thought that was so strange</p>\n<p>That I didn’t hear anything</p>\n<p>That Nancy had entered a new millenium, silently, as far as I could hear</p>\n<p>I felt</p>\n<p>Yeah well actually, all sorts of things</p>\n<p>I wanted to phone you, but then I thought: “Idiot, you just up and leave on a day like today and then go to phone her at midnight”</p>\n<p>So I didn’t phone</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> I know</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> It’s funny actually</p>\n<p>Well, funny…</p>\n<p>I can’t help noticing</p>\n<p>More and more</p>\n<p>How often you do things without really wanting to</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> Are you talking about that evening?</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> No yeah, well yeah</p>\n<p>I mean in general</p>\n<p>For myself</p>\n<p>That it’s funny</p>\n<p>How often I do things without really wanting to</p>\n<p>And don’t do what I actually want to do</p>\n<p>That evening too, I think, yeah</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> You don’t need to apologise</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> I’m not</p>\n<p>It’s more of an insight that comes after the event</p>\n<p>We probably all reach the same place in the end</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> Is that so?</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> The same conclusion I mean</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> And what is that conclusion then?</p>\n<p>According to you?</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> That we do what we’d rather not</p>\n<p>And don’t do what we’d rather do</p>\n<p><em>SHE laughs.</em></p>\n<p>That makes you laugh?</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> Yes, to hear you say that</p>\n<p>I think it’s funny</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> Oh</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> It is funny isn’t it?</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> If you say so</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> Are you getting touchy?</p>\n<p>You’re not going to start getting all touchy are you?</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> No</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> But?</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> But nothing</p>\n<p>Just…</p>\n<p><em>Short silence.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> Don’t you think it’s bizarre seeing each other here after all these years?</p>\n<p><em>HE says nothing.</em></p>\n<p>I do</p>\n<p>I think it’s bizarre</p>\n<p>Bizarre how things turn out</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> You could see it like that, yes</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> What would you call it then?</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> I haven’t given it that much thought</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> You haven’t given it that much thought?</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> No, I haven’t given it that much thought, no</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> You see me for the first time in ten years</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> Nine years</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> In this place</p>\n<p>And you haven’t given it that much thought</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> No</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> Unbelievable</p>\n<p>Is there anything you have given much thought?</p>\n<p>Like what we’re going to do if it is all true</p>\n<p>If it turns out that those two hundred graves do need to be moved</p>\n<p>What we’re going to do then?</p>\n<p>Where he’s supposed to go?</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> I want to hear what they’ve got to say first</p>\n<p>What the options are</p>\n<p>And the costs of course</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> The costs?</p>\n<p><strong>HE:</strong> There are bound to be costs</p>\n<p><strong>SHE:</strong> We’re talking about Jacob’s

then?</p>\n<p>HE:  I just meant it in general</p>\n<p>Please don’t do this</p>\n<p>You know I didn’t mean it like that</p>\n<p>It’s ridiculous to act as if I meant it like that</p>\n<p><em>SHE goes to
