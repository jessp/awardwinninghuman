{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Bosniana","content":"<p>Last Friday, I went to the supermarket with my cousin to buy some ingredients for stuffed grape leaves. We chose the worst hour of the worst day, sometime around 6pm, when everyone is on their way home from work and doing the grocery shopping for the weekend and the upcoming week.</p>\n<p>The checkout lines were endlessly long. Plus, an old lady standing in front of us had miscalculated and stuffed her shopping cart with more items than she had money for, so she was facing the difficult decision of what to return: a bag of chips or a roll of toilet paper.</p>\n<p>“Fuck the grape leaves,” I said to my cousin irritably. Immediately I caught the eye of a fellow standing in the line next to us.</p>\n<p>“Where are you guys from?”</p>\n<p>“Sarajevo, and you?”</p>\n<p>“Me too.”</p>\n<p>He reached out to shake our hands and introduced himself with a smile:</p>\n<p>“My name is Atif. Atif Abazović.”</p>\n<p>The name sounded familiar, and I could sort of recall his face: the way his eyes smiled, the way I couldn’t see his mouth from his thick moustache, and the way he pushed his glasses up his fairly large nose.</p>\n<p>The feeling was mutual, because he could swear that he also knew me from somewhere. As we walked out of the supermarket, we invited him for a drink across the street. He accepted, although he said that he had given up drinking a long time ago:</p>\n<p>“A year before the Olympics, I ended up in the hospital. It wasn’t much of a surprise; if you were to fill a swimming pool with all the liquor I drank that year, all that brandy, anisette, grappa, <em>Zve</em><em>čevo</em>, <em>Vlahov</em>, you’d drown before you reached the other end. And all I ate during that time were hot dogs from Gril, the joint across the street from the Second Gymnasium, and no more than the number of fingers on my hands. After that I had to get on the bandwagon.”</p>\n<p>My cousin and I ordered a Martel, and he got a pitcher of beer.</p>\n<p>We looked at each other confused, and he explained:</p>\n<p>“Beer is not alcohol–beer is food. Did you know that there is a sip of milk and a bite of meat in every beer?”</p>\n<p>That sounded familiar, as did his other stories: teachers from the Second Gymnasium, friends from Club FIS, waiters from the restaurant Stara Istra, girls from the Park café, small-time conmen from the bar Bulevar… It was as if he and I had been leading parallel lives and had never met, but instead crossed paths, passing each other in bar toilets, sitting in the same rows at the same cinemas, cheering at the same football games, riding in the same trams…</p>\n<p>“Atif, what are you doing now?”</p>\n<p>He lit a cigarette (again a familiar gesture), inhaled deeply, finished off his beer, wiped his moustache with his forearm, looked me straight in the eye and said:</p>\n<p>“I’m looking for a cure. But I haven’t had much luck. Look, I’ve been “abstaining” from Sarajevo for five years now. If I’d been a heroin addict all my life I’d be clean by now, but, for the life of me, I can’t get Sarajevo out of my blood. Sometimes, I feel like it is all over and done for, that I’ve kicked the habit, but the smallest detail–a familiar voice on the phone, a name in the newspaper, a dream–is enough to bring it all back, and then I go crazy from a desire to…to…I don’t know what…”</p>\n<p>We sat there drinking in silence because I knew (from my own experience) that it would be too cruel to ask:</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you go back?”</p>\n<p>We parted ways and promised to stay in touch.</p>\n<p>“God willing,” I added as always.</p>\n<p>I called my cousin last night to ask whether he had Atif’s address or phone number. He said he didn’t remember any Atif from the supermarket or having a drink with him.</p>\n<p>I replied that I wasn’t crazy, and he insisted that I must have made a mistake, that it must have been another day, that he had never left the house, and that he had been watching a basketball game on TV…</p>\n<p>Thinking about it now, I remember how Atif hadn’t bought anything at the supermarket (so why the fuck was he at the checkout?) and I wonder if I dreamt of Atif Abazović…</p>\n<p>Or did Atif dream of me?</p>\n","acf":{"author_name":"Ida Hegazi Høyer","country_name":"Bosnia","story_excerpt":"It wasn’t much of a surprise; if you were to fill a swimming pool with all the liquor I drank that year, all that brandy, anisette, grappa, Zvečevo, Vlahov, you’d drown before you reached the other end.","author_bio":"Ida Hegazi Høyer is the most renowned short story author of her generation and the most influential author of post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina.","author_photo":{"source_url":"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IdaHegazi-fullsize-FotoSveinFinneide-2-e1543862489761.jpg"},"location_photo":{"source_url":"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chelsea-london-phillips-780450-unsplash-e1541258087518.jpg"},"image_one":null,"image_two":null,"image_three":null,"image_four":null,"image_five":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Centropa","subtitle":"Centropa Restaurant in Bjørvika"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"633ccbff-b84f-5c89-b968-6b9391c76fd5"}}
